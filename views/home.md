## Getting started

This is the dashboard for the [AerynOS](https://aerynos.com) build infrastructure.
In order to contribute, visit the [documentation](https://aerynos.dev) and open a PR to the [recipes](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes) repository on GitHub.

### Current status

This infrastructure will be replaced with AerynOS-specific Rust-tooling and is effectively a stop-gap until the requirements for the new `stone format` are
fully understood.
