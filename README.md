# summit

Web dashboard for Serpent OS

## Focus:

We're not currently building a fully fledged dashboard, but instead focusing on a set of validation features to permit basic bootstrap escape.

## How to build

Depends on libsodium-devel and clones of summit (this repo), [moss-service](https://github.com/serpent-os/moss-service/) and [onboarding](https://github.com/serpent-os/onboarding/) living next to each other under a shared root (e.g. `~/repos/serpent-os`).

Run `dub build --parallel` to build.

## How to run

`dub run`
